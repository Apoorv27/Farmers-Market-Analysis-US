# Farmers-Market-Analysis-US

<h1>Aim:</h1><br/>
To analyze effect of Farmers Market Promotion Program (FMPP) on US market

<h1>What is FMPP?</h1> <br/>
FMPP is administered by USDAâ€™s Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS). The program awards competitive grants, with the goal of expanding access to locally produced agriculture products and developing new market opportunities for farms and ranches participating in direct farmer-to-consumer marketing. It connects consumers with where and how their food is grown, creates new economic opportunities for producers, and draws young people back to rural communities. 

8,675 markets 733 CSAs 1,393 on-farm markets 170 food hubs voluntarily listed in National Farmers Market Directory as of September 2016.Consumers purchased $1.4 billion worth of local food directly from farmers in 2012. 

FMPP provides resources to support outreach and promotional activities that help direct producer-to consumer markets become self-sustaining and can be repeated in communities across the country. These investments bring people together, support strong local and regional food systems, and increase access to healthy foods. Since the 2008 Farm Bill was enacted, FMPP has awarded over $58 million to 879 projects 



<h1>Conclusion:</h1><br/>
Farmers markets are an integral part of the urban/farm linkage and have continued to rise in popularity, mostly due to the growing consumer interest in obtaining fresh products directly from the farm. Direct marketing of farm products through farmers markets continues to be an important sales outlet for agricultural producers nationwide. Growth of 6% in the number of farmers suggest that the FMPP , andall supporting Payment programs are helping in fulfilling the common goal of an individual to eat fresh direct from the farm, enabling the farmers to develop a good healthy personal relationship with customers and maintain loyalty with them.
